## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned
    Working with tailwind css has made styling alot more easier and faster.Even though im still on the learning process on how to use tailwind better,i learnt alot; from styling of my text to its responsivisity... Just like adventure,knowing many more are to come...
 
 some cool tailwind styles i liked,used on my nave bar and moblie view nav when viewed on mobile devices
 ```css
<nav class="hidden lg:flex px-4 lg:px-20 py-3 bg-sky-300 text-white sticky top-0 z-50 border-b">
        <div class="flex flex-wrap item-center justify-between w-full gap-4">

 
<div class="lg:hidden flex justify-between items-center px-4 py-3 bg-sky-300 sticky top-0 z-50">
    <img src="https://tubidy.center/theme1/assets/logo-CsCrEMo0.png" alt="Tubidy" class="h-8">
    <button id="mobileMenuButton" class="text-2xl focus:outline-none">
      <i class="fas fa-bars"></i>
    </button>
  </div>
```

### Continued development
Focusing on improving my skill in using Tailwind for styling...until I become best at it...
